# You are a software engineer in a gaming company.
# You are tasked with creating the levels bridge pattern implementation.
# A level is the 3d environment the game character explore (no need to think on the 3d perspective).
# There are 4 levels: Mountains, Swamps, Beach & Forest.
# There are 4 seasons: Summer, Winter, Fall & Spring.
# Each level has different properties and common properties.
# Each level implements the weather conditions differently - it is less likely to snow at the beach then in the mountains.
